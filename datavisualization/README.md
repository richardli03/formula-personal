Current: we can take data in from an arduino spitting out random numbers and graph that in Graphana over time. 


## todo
- add in config file / udev for hardcoded values
- add in timeit python for code benchmarking

## [Work in Progress] installation instructions
pip install pyserial 

check serial ports, check code, TODO: include args
