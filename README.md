Hi! Welcome to my personal olin electric motorsports (formula) repo.

# About OEM:

We're a racing team based at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. The team is composed of a mechanical, electrical, and firmware subteam. 
On the electrical subteam, I'm currently working on our telemetry system, which is essentially the suite of tools we have to analyze what's going on
on the car as it races and tell the driver how best to drive in order to ensure the car is safe, fast, safe, efficient, and safe!

# Current project:
- Realtime data visualization
Realtime data visualization is key to how telemetry functions, as it's impossible to tell the driver anything if the team on the side of the road can't
tell what's going on! Our current workflow utilizes Grafana as our primary data visualization tool.
